# CS-Interview-Answers
I can break your algorithm coding interview in 4 files. If I can break your coding interview in 4 files, then your interview sucks. 

# Interview Questions
The "algorithm" style or first round of CS interviews will fall into 1 of 2 categories: 
 1. the hypothetical design a "system", or
 2. the notorious algorithm challenge. 

This codebase will focus on the latter.  

(For the first type, all I can say is you wont pass this. It's given by a moron who is looking for you to guess the magic word (s)he is thinking. It has nothing to do with designing a system, but allowing an interviewer to feel superior.) 

For the Data Structures and Algorithms portion of your interview, all questions are based upon 2 concepts: iterating and searching through various data structures. That's it. The only questions you will be asked are just variations on this concept. So here's the answers ahead of time. Just modify them to suit your interviewer's needs. 

In case you are still stressing, you WILL NOT be asked questions on sorting and nobody at any level is expecting you to whip out a Merge Sort, a Quick Sort, or solve the Traveling Salesman during an interview. So do not stress over this at all. I'm not saying don't understand this concepts and brush up on them, but relax, you aren't going to be asked to code them.

So here they are. You will be asked a variation on these data structures each which shows iterating and searcing.

So let's say you're an interviewer and reading this. Here's my encouragment to you: Stop asking them interviewer under stressful conditions to guess which algorithm solves it best. Just tell them. Warn the question up and talk to them about the concept and see if they are familar with it. Just say, "The optimal solution uses a breadth first search. Are you familar with that?" And if the answer is no, did you just learn in 2 seconds what would take 45 minutes to discover. And if so, then change the question to another CS Fundamental topic...unless of course your entire business model relise upon knowing that 1 algorithm ahead of time and could be looked up and learned 5 minutes after the interview, but should had been known before then. If that's not the case, then change the question you ask each candidate match their experience. The onus should be on the interview to vet the candidate, not the interviewee to guess which solution is optimal.
