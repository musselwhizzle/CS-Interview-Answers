# CS-Interview-Answers
I can break your algorithm coding interview in 4 files. If I can break your coding interview in 4 files, then your interview sucks. 

# Interview Questions
The "algorithm" style or first round of CS interviews will fall into 1 of 2 categories: 
 1. the hypothetical design a system, or
 2. the notorious algorithm challenge. 

This app will focus on #2. 

(For the first type, all I can say is you wont pass this. It's given by a moron who is looking for you to guess the magic word they are thinking. It has nothing to do with designing a system, but allowing an interviewer to feel superior.)
