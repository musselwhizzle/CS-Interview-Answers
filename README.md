# CS-Interview-Answers
I can break your algorithm coding interview in 4 files. If I can break your coding interview in 4 files, then your interview sucks. 

# Interview Questions
The "algorithm" style or first round of CS interviews will fall into 1 of 2 categories: 
 1. the hypothetical design a system, or
 2. the notorious algorithm challenge. 

This codebase will focus on the latter.  

(For the first type, all I can say is you wont pass this. It's given by a moron who is looking for you to guess the magic word (s)he is thinking. It has nothing to do with designing a system, but allowing an interviewer to feel superior.) 

The Data Structure and Algorithms porition of your interview will be on the few data sets covered below. And interviewers will only ask you questions based upon 2 concepts: iterating and searching. You WILL NOT be asked questions on sorting and nobody at any level is expecting you to whip out a Merge Sort of Quick Sort or solve the Traveling Salesman during an interview. So do not stress over this at all. All you need to know WELL are 2 concepts: how to iterate and search over various data structures. That's it. All questions you are asked will just be a varation over this base concept. So here's the answers ahead of time. Just modify them to suit your interviewer's needs.
